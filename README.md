# What is Iris?
Iris is a Roblox external, that was created mainly for **semi-rage**/**rage** purposes.

# Is Iris good?
This depends on your needs. **Personally**, I would say Iris is great, as a cheap external and it competes with other externals in terms of **functionality**. Iris is being worked on **daily** and is receives **frequent bug fixes**. Iris uses a **custom authentication method**, to ensure that it doesn't get **cracked**/**reverse-engineered** using basic & common attacks.

# This is probably just another antagonist paste, right?
No, Iris has been made from **scratch**. The **only thing** that **connects** these two externals together is the **overlay**. Otherwise, **NOTHING** in Iris is used from antagonist.

# Why is it so cheap? Seems like it shouldn't be trustworthy at such a low price.
Iris is currently cheap, due to it being in **early beta testing**. Upon **full release**, the price will be **extended** to **~$10-12**. It has **a small amount of features**, hence I don't think there is any reason to make it more **expensive** any time soon.

# Are there resellers? If so, can I sign up for reselling?
Yes, there **ARE** resellers. To **sign up** for reselling, you **must first pay** an **entry fee** of **$50**. Then, every key you buy will be discounted by **40%**, regardless if you buy one or more keys.
